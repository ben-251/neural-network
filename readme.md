# Neural Network from Scratch (NNFS)

The goal? train a simple artificial neural network to xor two floats.

for example:
0.54, 0.2 -> 1, since 1, 0 -> 1

0.02, 0,02 -> 0, since 0, 0 -> 0

Is this quite ambitious? Maybe. 
Will it be fun and full of mathsy hurdles to overcome? Absolutely.
So we'll see how this goes.
